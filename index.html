                    <span id="comment2-sentence2">I'm relying on Google translate here, but your source says "French is among the official languages of Vatican City, alongside Italian, the official language of the Vatican City State; from Latin, the official language of the Roman Catholic Church and the legal language of the Vatican; and German, the official language of the Vatican army, the Pontifical Swiss Guard." </span>
                    <span id="comment2-sentence3"><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Vatican_City>Languages of Vatican City</a> already discuss the use of other languages for diplomacy and the army, but only Italian is the official language of the city-state, which is the criteria in this article. </span>

                    <span id="comment4-sentence2">As far as a quick Google search goes, only Italian and Latin show up as official languages. </span>

                    <span id="comment4-sentence5">This does *not* reference to their usage as an official language for state or internal communications which is what an official language is. </span>
                    <span id="comment4-sentence6">Algeria and Morocco use French as a diplomatic language as well (plus in a lot more areas), you wouldn't list them as official would you? </span>

                    <span id="comment5-sentence2">One of the sources is Vatican News, a service provided by the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, in collaboration with the media offices of the Holy See according to what is said in the Wikipedia article dedicated to it. </span>
                    <span id="comment5-sentence3">Therefore, I think it is a reliable source which confirms my point, namely that French is one of the official languages of the Vatican. </span>
                    <span id="comment5-sentence4">I agree with you on the fact that it is not the most spoken or used language within the Papacy (French being an official language used mainly for diplomacy) but French remains an official language within the Vatican. </span>
                    <span id="comment5-sentence5">A language can be official and be little spoken within the population (this is the case for example in Vanuatu where French is only spoken by 37% of the population and yet French is one of the official languages of by France's colonial past but also for diplomacy). </span>
                    <span id="comment5-sentence6">The examples of Morocco and Algeria are different cases because they do not currently recognize French as an official language. </span>

                    <span id="comment6-sentence3">Italian appears to be the only official state language ("lâ€™italien, langue officielle de l'Ã‰tat de la CitÃ© du Vatican") with Latin used in internal governance ("langue juridique du Vatican"). </span>
                    <span id="comment6-sentence4">This means that Italian would be the only official language of the Vatican City state and Latin used in administration. </span>

                        <li><strong>Not Fully Addressed</strong>: OhNoitsJamie and Moalli did not address the argument that French, while not widely spoken, can still be an official language in diplomatic contexts.
